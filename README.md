# hello-world
Test repo to get used to Github workflow
I plan to use Github to facilitate and clean up my plans to build and write full stack code.  This will aid my understanding of production development processes.  Languages I plan to get better at: HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, JSON, AJAX, jquery angular.js, etc.
